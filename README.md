My results for your coding assignment.

Please note the following:

This assignment came blank. As in, I don't know your preferred style. My chosen style is not a reflection on the only way I would approach Unity and code. Having worked for more than 10 years in the field, I can easily adapt to any structure, and more importantly, requirements of a given situation, even though obviously I might like some ways more than others.

I opted now for a minimum boiler plate overload approach. So no use of any dependency injection framework, service locator pattern, or something similar. Just a clean structured scene. I also serialized everything in public fields. Why that way? Because of the limited scope of the assignment. Because I like to trust my peers, but make things sure with a good code review workflow. Because the assignment basically consisted of many small challenges and context switching, where a mental overload of following a framework would be detrimental to delivering results. Because I have seen coding assignments from the other side, and was thankful, if concepts were kept simple.  

 (Breaking my own rule there is utilizing my “AnimationThingy” class to handle most of the animations. Please feel free to ignore its content for the assignment like a black box, and hopefully enjoy how much more readable it makes treating animations.)
